# MRI Reconstruction with Non-Uniform GPU-NUFFT

## Overview
This repository contains code for performing MRI reconstruction using Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT) accelerated by GPUs. This implementation is specifically designed to handle non-uniformly sampled data points, which is a common scenario in advanced MRI techniques.

## Features (examples)
- **Non-Uniform Sampling**: Efficiently reconstruct MRI images from non-uniformly sampled k-space data.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Leverages GPU-NUFFT for high-performance computations, significantly speeding up the reconstruction process.

## Technologies Used
