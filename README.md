This repository contains matlab and c++ code for performing MRI reconstruction using Uniform and Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT). This implementation is designed to handle both uniform and non-uniformly sampled data points in k-space, which is a common scenario in advanced MRI techniques.

## Notes
This is just an initial publishing of the code. Soon I will clean and document the code. If you want to start using it the steps to follow are the following:
1) Clone the repository. 
2) Compile the cpp code using the function https://github.com/bmilani/monalisa/blob/main/src/bmMex/m/bmMex.m.
3) You are now ready to use the functions in the toolbox.
