This repository contains matlab and c++ code for performing MRI reconstruction using Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT). This implementation is designed to handle also non-uniformly sampled data points, which is a common scenario in advanced MRI techniques.

# MRI Reconstruction for non uniform trajectory

## Notes
This is just an initial publishing of the code. Soon we will clean and document the code. If you want to start using it the steps to follow are the following:
1) Pip install the repository
2) Compile the cpp code using the function https://github.com/bmilani/monalisa/blob/main/src/bmMex/m/bmMex.m.
3) You are now ready to use the functions in the toolbox.
